# Spoopy Discord Bot

## About the Project

The Spoopy Discord Bot retrieves information about a track, artist, or album based on a user's query, which is then displayed in a Discord embed. Spoopy uses the Spotipy Python wrapper for the official Spotify Web API.

### Example
When you enter ```.spoopy song out like a light``` on a Discord channel, Spoopy gives you this:
